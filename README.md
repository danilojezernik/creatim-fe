Application is about showing Yoda, Darth Vader and Obi-Wan Kenobi Star Wars characters and their respective details.
The application utilizes the Star Wars API (https://swapi.dev/) to dynamically fetch and display data about these iconic characters. 
Data retrieval is optimized using localStorage to store information locally. 
Additionally, the application features sound effects triggered when users interact with the Jedi names or encounter data discrepancies.
